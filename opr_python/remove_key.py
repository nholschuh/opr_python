    % This function removes keys from a dictionary based on a search criterion
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % The inputs are as follows:
    %
    %        d -- dictionary to filter
    %        key_to_remove -- This can be a string, a value, a type, or an integer, depending on the value of the next argument
    %        name0_value1_type2_length3 -- This allows you to filter based on the name of a key, the value associated with that key, 
    %                                       the type of value, or the length of the value. Keys/Values that match "key_to_remove" are removed
    %        remove_count=0 -- This should not be set by the user, but is required for the recursive code. This allows groups that are
    %                           emptied to, themselves, be removed, when using length == 0 as the criterion.
    % 
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % The outputs are as follows:
    %
    %       new_dict -- dictionary with the removed keys
    %       remove_count -- the number of entries removed
