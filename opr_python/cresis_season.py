    %     This function finds the season name associated with a flight day.
    % There are a small number of flight days in which two campaigns
    % were running apparently. By default, this code will assume you want
    % the Antarctic Season. You can force it to take the greenland season using
    % the given flag.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % The inputs are:
    %
    %     y - either the year, or a string for the filename you want the season for
    %     m - the month
    %     d - the day
    %     ant1_gre2 - force a particular continent for days where there are surveys in both places
    %
